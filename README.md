# Valorant-Random-Agent-selector

This is a simple python programme to pick a random valorant agent and lock it in it will work best if you are on a 2560x1440 moniter and own all the agents these 2 can be changed in order to work but currently only work properly with those.

The programme will automatically choose and lock in once its ran so it is best to run it once you get into the agent selection screens

I am not great at programming so i expect to be issues and the code could more than likely be improved but as it is it seems to work fine.

You could change the code if you wish for it to be suitable for your own moniter or the amount of agents you own if you have the knowledge.

This may require you to download certain modules in python to use
